# Hi, I'm Trio Wibowo! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a data analyst, with 3+ years of experience in analyze data to improve quality services and customer statisfaction. I attended training to improve skills in data processing, data storytelling, data mining, exploratory data analytics, and machine learning using programming languages like Python, SQL, Bigquery to solve problems.

## Background
This is case study from the Google Data Analytics Certificate about How did a bike-share business achieve success?

Cyclistic is the company bike-share from Chicago which has more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive for disabilities user and customer who cannot use standard two-wheeled bicycles. The majority of customer choose classic bikes. About 8% of drivers use the assistance option. Riders Bike are more likely to cycle for leisure, but around 30% use it to commute to work every day.

Currently Cyclistic's marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helps make this happen is price flexibility:
- one-way tickets,
- full-day tickets, and
- annual memberships
  
Customers who purchase a one-way ticket or a full day ticket are referred to as casual. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic's financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. While the price flexibility is helping Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (Marketing Directors) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth.

## Purpose
In this project, I am as a data analyst have task to collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
The stakeholder is come from :
- executive team (this team will decide whether they approve the recommended marketing), and
- Lily Moreno (Marketing Directors)

In this case I have a big qutestion "How is the trend of casual and members user using Cyclistic bicycles differently?" From this question we a goal to created a new marketing strategy for convert casual riders bike to join in membership.

## Flow
So that for this case, I use **6 (six) Steps of Process Analysis** :
